General Steps:

1. Create functions for loading both the username and secret databases into memory.
2. Make sure the server works, but the writeup makes it seem like it should already be good to go.
3. Once a client connects, we have two different situations to program.
	a. The client has a cookie from a previous session.
	b. The cient does not have a cookie.
4. Once credentials are established, the requested data will be transmitted.
5. Send the client a cookie when closing the connection.

Things to keep in mind:

Cookie: We will need to make sure we understand what kind of information we need to send for the cookie.
	This may be in the writeup already; I haven't checked for it.
